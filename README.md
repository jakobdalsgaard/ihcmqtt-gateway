Ihc Mqtt Gateway
================

A simple IHC-MQTT Gateway; given connection details to an IHC Controller it downloads the project
file and subscribes on events from dataline inputs and outputs. Furthermore it subscribes to topics
in MQTT corresponding to each dataline output in the IHC project file.
